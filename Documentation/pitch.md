### (INTRO)
Hello, I’m Elizabeth Rasmussen, a member of Raman Noodles.

You know how we all have a unique fingerprint that can identify us from someone else, say Beyonce, or Dave Beck?

Raman Spectroscopy is a powerful method used, like fingerprinting, to identify molecules. And like darkness of the ink in fingerprinting shows how much pressure was applied, a raman spectroscopy signal can even inform how much of a substance is present. 

### (PROBLEM)
The issue comes when you have a mixture of different molecules, the raman spectra ends up looking like a bowl of tangled up ramen noodles.

### (CURRENT SOLUTIONS)
While there is raman spectra analysis software out there, but it is slow, expensive, and requires deep user knowledge about raman spectroscopy.

### (OUR SOLUTION)
What we have done this quarter is create a fast automated, free open source solution that can identify individual molecules in a mixture and calculate the decomposition of their presence across changing temperatures and times.

Taking it a step further we then created a testing/training data set of over 10,000 raman spectra and applied machine learning models to experimental raman spectra collected here on campus and were able to classify and predict the decomposition and presence of molecules.

Through every step of this code base the user is informed and presented with (#) advanced visualizations of their data giving increased control and  intelligence to large data sets.

### (CLOSURE)
Although there is future work we’d like to see done, we are proud of the progress we made this quarter and excited to show you the research possibilities we’ve enabled through our code, and the DIRECT program guidance.

### (CALL TO ACTION- VISIT OUR BOOTH)
So please come check out our booth so we can show you how we are identifying, calculating and machine learning our through Raman noodles.

Thank you!
