### (INTRO)
Hello, I’m Elizabeth Rasmussen, a member of Raman Noodles.

You know how we all have a unique fingerprint that can identify us from someone else, say Beyoncé, or Dave Beck?

Raman Spectroscopy is a powerful method used, like fingerprinting, to identify molecules. And like darkness of the ink in fingerprinting shows how much pressure was applied, a Raman spectra signal can show how much of a molecule is present.

### (PROBLEM)
The issue comes when you have a mixture of different molecules, the Raman spectra ends up looking like a bowl of tangled up ramen noodles.

### (CURRENT SOLUTIONS)
While there is analysis software out there, it takes days to compute, is expensive, and requires deep user knowledge to parse through the data.

### (OUR SOLUTION)
What we have done this quarter is reduce the analysis time from days to seconds by creating an automated and free open source solution that can identify individual molecules in a mixture and calculate the molar yield across changing temperature and residence times.

At this speed it, we enable real time in-situ analysis for applications ranging from quality control monitoring to defining chemical reaction pathways.

Taking it a step further we applied machine learning models to an augmented data set of over 10,000 Raman spectra and validating with experimental Raman spectra collected here on campus were able to classify the presence of molecules with a reduced false classification by 50 percent.

Finally, we have given the user increased control and intelligence to large data sets through 17 advanced visualization tools.

### (CLOSURE)
We have a lot of ideas to add more functionality, but we are proud of the progress we made this quarter and excited to show you the possibilities we’ve enabled through our code, and the DIRECT program guidance.

### (CALL TO ACTION- VISIT OUR BOOTH)
So please come check out our booth so we can show you how we are identifying, calculating and machine learning our way through Raman noodles.


Thank you!
