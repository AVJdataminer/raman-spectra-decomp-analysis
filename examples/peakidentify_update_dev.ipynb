    "\n",
    "`peak_assignment` takes as parameters five arguments, of which 2 are optional. First, we must pass the hdf5 filename from the experiment hdf5 file, which is the `hdf5_expfilename`. The second parameter is the key from the experiment hdf5 file, which is the `expkey`. The third parameter is the the hdf5 filename from the calibration hdf5 file, which is the `hdf5_filename`. This calibration hdf5 file contains a list of all of the compounds that you want to check your unknown data for. In other words, if a compound data is not passed in this list, then the function will not look to see if that compound is present in your unknown spectrum. Each of these compounds can be refered to by the key function of the hdf5 file. The fourth parameter contains a list of strings all of the compounds that that are in that calibration file mentioned before.  This is the list that we generated above titled `list_of_compounds`, which we passed data for carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane. An additional note is that the list of compounds from the calibration file will be listed alphabetically due to the functions of the hdf5 file format. Matching this alphabetical order is important when referencing the `list_of_compounds`. Parameter 5 is `precision`, which is an optional parameter. It is defaulted to 0.08, but can be adjusted by passing a different float value. What it does is it sets a boundary for how close the known peak position has to be to an unknown peak for the function to assign the peak. It is a percentage value, so 0.08 is 8 % of the larger of the two peak positions. The default of .08 will encompass all of the peaks in this example, but adjustments are recommended for your own experimental/calibration data. Finally, parameter 6 is `plot`, which is also an optional parameter. It is a Boolean which defaults to True. If True, this will plot the unknown specrta and labels for all of the peaks in said spectra. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, we won't mess with those optional parameters.\n",

    "This function will output the list of known peaks for each compound and the plot for the unknown specrta and labels for all of the peaks in said spectra. Additionally, it will output a percentage of how many of the material's peaks are found in the unknown spectrum. This can be used as a metric of confidence."

For example, if 1 peak out of 10 possible are found as is the case for carbon dioxide above, it will show a percentage of 10%, whereas for water if it find 3 peaks out of a possible 3, the percentage reported is 100%.

    "So, this function, when called to compare water to the unknown peaks, or carbon monoxide to the unknown peaks, we see that it returns an array of 1 and 0. This array is an assignment array. If the array contains a 0, the peak in that position is not found in the known compound. For example, for the water peak comparison, the value of the returned array is 1 at position 0. That means that it is assigning the peak found at position 0 to be possibly coming from water. The 0 in position 2 implies that the unknown peak is not found in water. If we look at position 2 in the carbon monoxide comparison, we see that it is a 1 there. This implies that the peak in position 2, is likely not coming from water, and could possibly be coming from carbon monoxide."
