"""
This module allows for baseline subtraction using polynomial subtraction at a user-specified
degree, peak detection using scipy.signal find_peaks module, and then utilizes
Lorentzian fitting of spectra data, enabling extraction of full-width, half-max peak data.
Note that Lorentzian fitting was chosen explicitly as it is the proper descriptor of peak
shapes from Raman spectra.

Developed by the Raman-Noodles team.

    """
    Function that utilizes scipy to find peak maxima from input spectral data. Default
    detection parameters are chosen for the user based upon values that worked well during
    initial testing of the function; however, the option remains to adjust the parameters
    to achieve the best fit, if the user so chooses.
    WARNING: This function may return unexpected results or unreliable results for data
    that contains NaNs. Please remove any NaN values prior to passing data.

    Args:
        x_data (list like): The x-values of the spectra from which peaks will be detected.
        y_data (list like): The y-values of the spectra from which peaks will be detected.
        height (float): (Optional) The minimum floor of peak-height below which all peaks
                        will be ignored. Any peak that is detected that has a maximum height
                        less than `height` will not be collected. NOTE: This value is highly
                        sensitive to baselining, so the Raman-noodles team recommends ensuring
                        a quality baseline before use.
        prominence (float): (Optional) The prominence of the peak. In short, it's a comparison
                            of the height of a peak relative to adjacent peaks that considers
                            both the height of the adjacent peaks, as well as their distance
                            from the peak being considered. More details can be found in the
                            `peak_prominences` module from scipy.
        distance (float): (Optional) The minimum distance between adjacent peaks.

    Returns:
        peaks (list): A list of the x and y-values (in a tuple) where peaks were detected.
        peak_list (list): An list of the indices of the fed-in data that correspond to the
                          detected peaks as well as other attributes such as the prominence
                          and height.
